# dashboard  
Project: Admin Dashboard    
--> use CSS Grid primarily for page layout  
--> responsive (but not optimized for small screens)  
--> linked to various pages  
--> buttons lack functionality  
  
I took the assignment in a slightly different direction, as though it was a profile page featuring Amity's content with different brands. I'm imagining that I'll build something similar when I build her a website.
  
  
What I'd like to improve:  
--> on smaller screens, left sidebar minimizes (use a modal for on hover?)  
--> not exceedingly happy with display on right sidebar, especially on widest screen views  
--> JS functionality for search, notifications, like + share buttons, etc.  
--> would users have to have an acct to like / share, etc.?  
--> feel free to share ideas
